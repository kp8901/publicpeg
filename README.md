**OpenShift Migration Documentation for Pega PRPC Applications**

### Introduction
This document outlines the process for migrating Pega PRPC applications within an OpenShift environment. It includes key definitions, planning, and execution strategies necessary for a successful migration.

### OpenShift Overview
**OpenShift** is a Kubernetes distribution from Red Hat designed for enterprise applications. It enhances Kubernetes with additional features and tools to help developers build, deploy, and manage containerized applications more efficiently.

### Key Concepts
- **Namespace:** A namespace in OpenShift partitions resources among multiple users, creating dedicated environments for each project or team.
  
- **Service Account:** A service account provides an identity for processes running in a Pod, allowing these processes to interact with the Kubernetes API.

### Reasons for Cluster Migration
- **Hardware Upgrades:** To leverage more advanced or efficient hardware technologies.
- **Cost Optimization:** To reduce costs through more efficient resource utilization.
- **Enhanced Security:** To benefit from advanced security features and configurations.
- **Geographical Distribution:** To reduce latency and comply with data residency laws.

### Migration Planning
#### Strategy Development
- **Finalize Migration Strategy:** Choose between lift-and-shift, re-platforming, or refactoring based on the needs and current architecture of the Pega PRPC applications.
- **Migration Schedule:** Develop a detailed schedule to minimize downtime, coordinating with all relevant teams.

#### Environment Preparation
- **Source and Target Environments:** Ensure readiness by performing final checks on network configurations, storage, and computing resources.
- **Security Configurations:** Implement necessary security measures, adjusting for new AD groups and service accounts.

### Data and Application Migration
#### Container Image Preparation
- Prepare and optimize container images for the migration, potentially updating or making necessary configuration changes.

#### Data Migration
- Execute a data migration strategy suitable for the applicationâ€™s needs, such as backup and restore, replication, or direct migration.

#### Application Migration
- Migrate Pega PRPC application instances. Ensure they are configured to interact with the new shared drive and utilize the new AD groups and service accounts.

### Post-Migration Testing
#### Functional and Regression Testing
- **Functional Testing:** Verify that all functionalities of the Pega application work as expected in the new environment.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure that existing features and modules are not affected by the migration.

#### Integration Testing
- **Services and APIs:** Check that all integrated services, APIs, and external systems are communicating correctly with the Pega application.
- **Database Connections:** Confirm that the application is properly connected to the database and functioning correctly.

### Additional Considerations
- **AD Groups:** Manage and streamline access controls for different teams working on the Pega PRPC application.
- **Service Accounts:** Automate and secure operations within OpenShift, enhancing the security and efficiency of the Pega PRPC applications.

### Conclusion
This document provides a comprehensive plan for migrating Pega PRPC applications within an OpenShift environment, ensuring minimal disruption and optimal performance in the new setup.
